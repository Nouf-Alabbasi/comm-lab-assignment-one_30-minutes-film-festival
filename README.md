**Project Name:** Communication Lab assignment 1: 30MFF <br>
**Project Description:** For this project, we were asked to create a website to house our 30MFF videos. For my website, I wanted to incorporate the fun aspect of the video into the design of the web pages. The web page is inspired by comic books in some aspects like the font on the button page and the solid shadows. 
the titles of the subparts of the page are inspired by the text used in the video, "this is our video", where they are vague and they state the obvious which I thought was a funny aspect of the video. the eyes that appear add an element of surprise and fun to the website and creates a more enjoyable experience for the person watching the video. The two buttons on the side of the video incorporate some prominent audio elements from the video this adds an element of interactivity because each viewer has a unique watching experience. <br>
**Reflection/Evaluation:** I tried to stick to the initial layout, which I believe I did well. The color palette change many times in the process though, it started as something along the lines of:

where the colors were muted but I decided that the muted color palette doesn't reflect my desired design so I used brighter colors (as seen in the current website). the placement of objects and responsivity of them was challenging at times, but I eventually got everything to do what I wanted it to do. One thing I still need to figure out is how to make a mobile version compatible with the appearance. I also tried using the grid to try out the initial layout but decided to not use it now because I wanted to hone my basic CSS skills before moving on. (the images below are only placeholders)
